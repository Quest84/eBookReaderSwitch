### Credit:
* moronigranja - For allowing more file support
* NX-Shell Team - A good amount of the code is from an old version of their application.

### Building
* Release built with [libnx release v4.1.3](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx).
* Uses `freetype` and other libs which comes with `switch-portlibs` via `devkitPro pacman`:
```
pacman -S libnx switch-portlibs
```
then run:
```
make mupdf
make
```
to build.

If you don't have twili debugger installed, delete the `-ltwili` flag on the Makefile to compile:
```
LIBS: -ltwili
```
